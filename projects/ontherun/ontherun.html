It’s what sets it apart from running on a treadmill. It’s a great way to enjoy the fresh air and get a good workout in.</p><p name="3db0" id="3db0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now how do outdoor runners plan their run? We did some research and found out that most outdoor runners like to run based on distance. Running a consistent distance makes it easy to track your progress.</p><p name="195e" id="195e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there currently aren’t many useful tools for runners to plan out their path. For example GoogleMaps is really good at telling you the fastest way to get from point A to point B, but doesn’t offer a way to customize the actual path. Apps like MapMyRun and Strava, though designed for runners, also don’t give users a lot of freedom in creating a custom path.</p><p name="7c2f" id="7c2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result, a lot of outdoor runners end up running the same route over and over again. They like the consistency in distance to track their progress, but it eventually gets boring. So we have this problem of being able to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">find new, interesting paths that also meets the runner’s fitness needs.</strong></p><p name="b382" id="b382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, we made <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the Run</em>.</p><p name="b314" id="b314" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the Run</em> is a tool for outdoor runners to create their own custom running experience. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On the Run</em> allows its user to draw different routes and get the most out of their workout by calculating the mileage, estimated time, and predicted calories burned. This app changes how runners can keep track of their progress by providing a way to explore new paths but with consistent distances or times.</p><figure name="c79f" id="c79f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 1059px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 176.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DVhawjjQ3zGpgnfdUTqJug.gif" data-width="600" data-height="1059" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DVhawjjQ3zGpgnfdUTqJug.gif"></div></figure><h3 name="fdab" id="fdab" class="graf graf--h3 graf--hasDropCapModel graf-after--figure">The Design Process</h3><p name="61eb" id="61eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In order to achieve the final implementation, we went through multiple cycles of researching, making prototypes, getting feedback, and revising our work. We started off brainstorming a bunch of ideas, narrowing it down to one favorite, interviewing potential users, and designing an interface. Once we got the design down we began implementing an interactive prototype using CodeAnywhere.</p><h3 name="eaf5" id="eaf5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Collaborative Plan</h3><h4 name="41fa" id="41fa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Goals</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="008f" id="008f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Personal Goals</strong><br>Ashley Park: Improve coding abilities<br>Chae Yoon Lee: Learn process of figuring out what the user really wants<br>William Cheng: Become a better coder in html, css, and javascript. <br>Yuki Zhang: Become a better coder in html, css, and javascript.</li><li name="07dd" id="07dd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Project Goal<br></strong>Our project goal is to make an app that allows the user to draw the route he wants to run on, and keep track of the miles he has ran and the calories they burned.</li><li name="70c6" id="70c6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Metrics for success</strong><br>We want to stay on schedule and take into consideration the opinion of possible users through research and observations.

We started off by pitching any idea that came to mind and trying to bounce ideas off of each other. We came up with things like a lesson planner for teachers, a recipe book for home cooks, even a way to create a grocery list for the average supermarket goer. After coming up with about ten ideas, we narrowed it down to three favorites:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="b2ff" id="b2ff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Cooking substitutions: An app for home cooks to easily find substitutions for missing ingredients.</li><li name="daf2" id="daf2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Lesson planning: A tool for elementary school teachers to plan their daily lesson plan.</li><li name="128c" id="128c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Run planner: An app for outdoor runners to plan their route by sketching out a path on a map.</li></ol><figure name="671f" id="671f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 199px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 28.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aVTrShlRlVggFgFReUzN8Q.png" data-width="1262" data-height="358" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aVTrShlRlVggFgFReUzN8Q.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sketches for our three favorite ideas</figcaption></figure><p name="8822" id="8822" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We then presented our three ideas to the entire class in a quick lightning pitch to get a feel for which idea was the most promising. Based on the feedback from our peers and instructors, it seemed that the most exciting idea was a tie between the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">baking substitutions</strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">run planning</strong> apps.</p><p name="b21b" id="b21b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For both ideas we had people say that they’ve encountered the problem it was trying to fix and that they’d be interested in using the app. A couple concerns noted after our critiques were the usability of the baking app (ie how often would someone be missing an ingredient) and the implementation of the running app (having access to relevant data). Taking this into consideration, we decided to interview prospective users in each user group to narrow it down to one project idea.</p><h3 name="1e8e" id="1e8e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Observation Study Protocol</h3><p name="f50a" id="f50a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">User Groups:</strong><br>- Amateur bakers<br>- Outdoor runners</p><p name="1a7e" id="1a7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Interview Plan:</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="9fcc" id="9fcc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Briefly introduce ourselves and our purpose for interview.</li><li name="a5bb" id="a5bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Questions for the users:<br>For bakers:<br>- What difficulties have you confronted when you bake?<br>- Where do you find your recipes?<br>- Have you ever been missing ingredients?

And if I’m missing a key ingredient from a recipe I’ll decide to make it another day.</li><li name="9c72" id="9c72" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: Are there any difficulties in searching for a substitution?<br>A: Not really, it’s pretty easy to find them online. Plus I don’t really like risking a different taste or texture if I substitute an ingredient for a recipe I already know I like, so most of the time if I’m missing something I’ll either run to the store to buy it or just not make it.</li></ul><p name="31d8" id="31d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Interviewee 2:</strong> College student who likes to run for exercise.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bd8c" id="bd8c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Q: How often do you run outside?<br>A: I try to run at least twice a week, maybe three times if I have time.</li><li name="f5df" id="f5df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: How do you plan your running route?<br>A: I usually run from my apartment down the street until I hit Safeway.

Google Maps gives you the fastest way to get to a certain location, which isn’t necessarily the way I want to run. The only way I could customize that would be to add several stops.</li></ul><p name="7179" id="7179" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Findings</strong><br>Based on our interviews we found that most bakers don’t really see a need for an app dedicated to substitutions.

For our prototype, we’d like to display the incline/decline but probably won’t be able to implement it based on actual data but we can definitely include it in our UI. We also thought that we could offer users a prediction of how much time the route should take and how many calories they would burn if they ran at a certain speed.

I like that the distance and calories change as I created the path. I think the freehand drawing was a little harder to use because you aren’t bound to streets or roads and you’re allowed to draw over houses and buildings you have to be a little more careful with how you draw. I also had some trouble scrolling without accidentally drawing on the map.</li><li name="beba" id="beba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: What else would you suggest be added to the application?<br>A: I think some way to turn off the drawing ability so that I can zoom or tap the screen without messing up my drawing path.</li><li name="0675" id="0675" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: Which variant did you prefer?<br>I think the drawing one, even though you can draw over things you can’t run over, I think it was more intuitive for me to use. If you didn’t tell me about the two different variants and gave me this app I would’ve assumed that it had a drawing feature, not adding points.</li></ul><p name="b1c9" id="b1c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">User 2: </strong>UC Berkeley student</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7cb4" id="7cb4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Q: How often do you run?<br>A: I run almost every day, an average of five to six times a week.</li><li name="0c66" id="0c66" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: How many miles do you run during your exercise?<br>A: I run around 3 to 4 miles a day.</li><li name="bf2c" id="bf2c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: Do you feel like you are more of a competitive or leisure runner?<br>A: I just run because it is healthy and helps me relax after my studies, so I am more of a leisure runner.</li><li name="4318" id="4318" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: Have you ever used a running application before?<br>A: Nope</li><li name="372b" id="372b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: What did you enjoy about using the application?<br>A: I really like how I can see how many calories I would burn if I ran a certain path within a certain time.

Even though I felt like it took a little longer to make the path, I like having more control over the path. I also like how I can see it as it’s drawn. I feel like with the adding points one if I didn’t put the point in the right place it was more of a hassle to undo and redo.</li><li name="cb45" id="cb45" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Q: What else would you suggest be added to the application?<br>A: Since it was hard of tapping the exact location some sort of zoom tool</li></ul><p name="ab55" id="ab55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">User Evaluation Findings<br></strong>Both users preferred the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">freehand drawing variant</strong>, even though it took a little more time for them to draw the instructed path. Both users liked the freedom that drawing a path had that adding points did not. Both users also had some <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">problems with navigating around the map</strong>. We decided to add a move functionality to toggle with the drawing functionality. So if the Move button was highlighted, drawing was turned off, and vice versa.</p><h3 name="8fe3" id="8fe3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Final User Evaluation</h3><p name="5a84" id="5a84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At our final design showcase, users were able to interact with our final implementation. Participants were approached with the task of creating their own one mile course and checking out how the distance, time and calories change.</p><p name="007d" id="007d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Results<br></strong>For the most part the interaction was pretty simple. One thing we saw some people have difficulties with however was that the app starts off in the moving mode and it wasn’t intuitive that you had to click on the arrows icon to switch to drawing mode.</p><p name="e272" id="e272" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the time limitations of this project and the scope of the class, our final implementation showcased the main functionality of our idea, drawing a custom path and calculating the distance, but there were definitely a lot of places our app could grow and improve in, and we got a lot of great feedback on how we could take things to the next level. The biggest one was integrating GoogleMaps and gathering data from GoogleMaps such as incline and decline. Another great idea we received was being able to connect our app with a heart monitor and using that information to tell users whether they should take it easy or push their limits for that day.</p><h3 name="e6f4" id="e6f4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h3><p name="ef34" id="ef34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This project taught us a lot about the entire design process of making an app. We had to do a lot of repetitions of designing, prototyping, and evaluating to get to our final implementation, and even after that we still have ideas on how to change our app for the better. One thing this class taught all of us was how difficult application design could be and how there are so many designs we interact with everyday that we take for granted.</p><p name="1355" id="1355" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, this project was really exciting to us because most of us have dealt with the problem of trying to find a running path ourselves. It was also super rewarding when at the design showcase people who’ve dealt with this problem too were really interested in our application.</p><h3 name="2616" id="2616" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Appendix</h3><p name="9f9f" id="9f9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing"><a href="https://github.com/clee8420/cs160FinalPorject" data-href="https://github.com/clee8420/cs160FinalPorject" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github Code</a><br><a href="https://pin.it/axb6anal3rf6mc" data-href="https://pin.it/axb6anal3rf6mc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Logo and Description</a><br><a href="https://pin.it/u4f2j6r7a74ztd" data-href="https://pin.it/u4f2j6r7a74ztd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advertising Image</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/cCRyZ6KnnCo" data-href="https://youtu.be/cCRyZ6KnnCo" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Final Video</a><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_NsfKIMdAghcg1-9giloP00SNnsKfkHK/view?usp=sharing" data-href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_NsfKIMdAghcg1-9giloP00SNnsKfkHK/view?usp=sharing" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poster</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e-wGeNGKBHK2PbzZr2jGWRdnz1WinkDZVBH-I7AEoow/edit?usp=sharing" data-href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e-wGeNGKBHK2PbzZr2jGWRdnz1WinkDZVBH-I7AEoow/edit?usp=sharing" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pitch Slides</a></p></div></div></section>
